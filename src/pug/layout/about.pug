      P
        | Programming allows me create lots of
        span="awesome"
        | stuff. 
        | That's why I love creating
        span="Front-end"
        | for websites. This is the thing that attracts customers. 
        | In the meantime I am looking for
        span="starting"
        | positions to become part of a cool team and great teammate myself. 
        | Go ahead and try my
        span="projects,"
        | they will tell you more than just sweet words.
